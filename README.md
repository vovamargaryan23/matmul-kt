# matmul-kt

Small, self-contained dense matrix multiplication library:
- C++ native backend (`backend/`)
- Kotlin Multiplatform wrapper (`library/`)
    - JVM (via JNI)
    - Kotlin/Native (Linux `linuxX64`, Windows `mingwX64`)
- Tests for JVM and Native
- Gradle automation builds native code (CMake) and stages shared libs for both JVM and K/N.

## Prerequisites

### Linux
- `git`
- `cmake` (â‰¥ 3.10)
- `gcc` / `g++` and `make`
- Java JDK (11+)
- `./gradlew` (included wrapper, no need to install Gradle)

### Windows

- MinGW-w64 (or MSYS2) toolchain in `PATH` for building DLL
- `cmake`
- Java JDK (11+)
